_moviedb_ is an application that uses [the Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and is built with React.
The application was created for demo purposes and shows some [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) concepts.

To retrieve data from the Movie Database, an API key must be generated first. To register for an API key, click the [API link](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) from within your account settings page.
Access to the movie database is free of charge. More information about authentication and using the API can be found in the [documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/).
